# Face Recognition in Python

## Requirements
Before running the "main" jupter notebook you will need to install some dependencies. 

It is recommended you use a virtual environment like venv or conda. If you are using conda you can create a virtual env by pasting this command: `conda create -n env_name python=3.12`, python 3.12 is used and tested.

To install the dependencies you will need to use `pip` manager by simply pasting this command `pip install -r requirements.txt` however the PyTorch requirements varies by operating system thus you may need to edit the requirements to the recommeneded one from `https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/`.
